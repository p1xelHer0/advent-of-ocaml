(* Hello, welcome to Advent of Code and OCaml! *)

open ContainersLabels
(* open Containers *)

(* I prefer labeled arguments.

   - This is `fold_left` with labeled argumnets, ~f and ~init are labels.
     `List.fold_left ~f:( + ) ~init:0`
     `List.fold_left ~init:0 ~f:( + )`

   - Labeled arguments also have "punning", meaning that if `f` is defined
     `let f = ( + )`
     then we can omit the `:` part completly
     `List.fold_left ~init:0` ~f`


   - This is `fold_left` without labeled arguments, order matters, like you
     are probably used to
     `List.fold_left ( + ) 0`

   See: https://ocaml.org/docs/labels

   If you don't want this, open Containers instead of ContainersLabels. *)

(* Advent of Code usually provides of with some smaller examples.
   I usually do inline testing to verify that my solution matches the examples.

    OCaml supports multi-line strings by default. *)

(* Paste sample data here *)

(* If some parts of a solution is used in both Part_1 and Part_2 I place the
   outside the modules *)
