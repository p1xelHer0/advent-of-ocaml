val run_1 : unit -> unit
(** [run_1 ()] runs part 1.

    It should call one of two functions:
    [Run.solve_int] or [Run.solve_string]
    depending on your output from your [solve input] function.

    Your [solve input] function needs to be of type
    [string -> int] or [string -> string] to be able to
    use the [Run.solve_int] or [Run.solve_string] helpers. *)

val run_2 : unit -> unit
