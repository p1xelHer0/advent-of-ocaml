# ✨🐫🎄 Advent of OCaml 🎄🐫✨

> So you are thinking about doing [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023/) in [OCaml](https://ocaml.org/)? Great choice!

## Setting up the project

The official package manage of OCaml is Opam (OCaml Package Manager). Install
it by following the official instructions:

- https://ocaml.org/install

After Opam has been installed you can use the provided `Makefile` to get
going:

> NOTE: If you already have an old installation of Opam make sure you run `opam
update` before setting up

```
make setup
```

After the installation you can build the project with

```
make build
```

To start working on a day run

```
make day1
```

## Before coding

> Some personal notes:
>
> Advent of Code is _hard_.
>
> I don't work with these kind of algorithm-y problems on a day-to-day basis. I guess most people don't. It's very easy to get imposter syndrome and compare yourself to others. Others that do good in Advent of Code has probably done so for some time.
>
> Find a group and discuss the problems with others. You probably have a colleague at work that does Advent of Code without you even knowing.
>
> Focus on learning and having fun.
>
> And lose a bit of sleep!
